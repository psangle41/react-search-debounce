This project shows two types of input components in React: controlled and uncontrolled. It also demonstrates how to use debouncing to make input handling more efficient.

## What is Debouncing?

Debouncing is a technique used to limit how often a function is executed. Instead of calling the function on every keystroke, debouncing ensures that the function is only called once after the user stops typing. This helps to:

- **Reduce API calls:** Prevents making too many requests while the user is still typing.
- **Improve performance:** Keeps the app running smoothly by limiting function calls.
- **Enhance user experience:** Makes the app feel more responsive.
